expanded-ensembles
==================

Experiments with expanded ensembles to explore chemical space. Initially, this repository will contain code to perform fluorine scans on ligands--in other words, allow hydrogens to become fluorines in the simulation, biased in order to sample the tightest-binding variant the most.
