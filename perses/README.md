Package for simulation of expanded ensembles using openmm and python with various methods.

Subpackages
-----------
* rjmc - Code that performs Reversible-Jump specific functionality, such as dimension matching proposals

* multitopology - Code that implements a lambda-selectable multitopology for openmm

* dualtopology - Code that implements a lambda-selectable dual topology, allowing interpolation between two states

* bias - Tools for calculating a state-dependent biasing weight

* Annihilation - Tools for alchemically modifying systems to facilitate NCMC moves between states
